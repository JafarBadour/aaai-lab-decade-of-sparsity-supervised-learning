# Core dependencies for AAAI 2026 Tutorial: A Decade of Sparse Training
# Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) implementation with MNIST

# PyTorch ecosystem
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0

# Numerical computing
numpy>=1.24.0

# Scientific computing (for sparse matrices)
scipy>=1.10.0

# Visualization
matplotlib>=3.7.0
cupy-cuda12x
# Required: CuPy for truly sparse CSR operations (GPU or CPU mode)
# IMPORTANT: Do NOT install cupy from PyPI (it builds from source - very slow!)
# Instead, install the pre-built wheel matching your CUDA version:
#   pip install cupy-cuda12x       # For CUDA 12.x (RECOMMENDED for your system)
#   pip install cupy-cuda11x       # For CUDA 11.x
#   pip install cupy-cpu          # CPU-only version (no GPU support)
# 
# Note: cupy-cuda12x provides both GPU and CPU support
# cupy>=12.0.0  # Commented out - install cupy-cuda12x manually instead
